# Data
Repository to hold data files used for this project


Case and Death data taken from [New York Times GitHub](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

US population estimates taken from [here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/download-data/)
The population estimate was then edited into a CSV by copying and pasting state, county, and 2019 population estimates into a new file to have the most pertinent and important information available. Territory population data (and fips codes) were manually added to CSV based on google searches.

Reopening data was taken from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html) as well as multiple sources on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state_and_local_government_response_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic).

The Forecasted folder holds CSVs for the predicted values for each state

The Graphs folder holds the graph images of the predicted values compared with the actual values for each state

The Region_Graphs folder holds the graph images of the seperate regions

The Region_Data folder holds the CSV files for the indivdual regions as well as the region averages
