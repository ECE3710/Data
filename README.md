# Data
Repository to hold data files used for this project

Potential places to get data from:

https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases

https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset

[Github data base](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) ; [Link originally found here](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)

https://covidtracking.com/data

[Racial tracker](https://covidtracking.com/race) : racial data CSV taken from here

[Government response tracker](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker) has several links to csv files and github pages

[Has a few potential sources/locations for data](https://guides.ucsf.edu/COVID19/data)

[World Health Organization](https://covid19.who.int/) : US data CSV taken from here

[New York Times GitHub](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) Cases in US by State and County, as well as country-wide cases

US population estimates taken from https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/download-data/
The population estimate was then edited into a CSV by copying and pasting state, county, and 2019 population estimates into a new file to have the most pertinent and important information available

Land size data was taken from here https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2011/compendia/usa-counties-2011.html#LND
I used the most recent(2010) total land aread per county, in square miles, rather than total area as that includes water area, my thinking being we can look at population density also if we wanted to.

Reopening data was taken from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html) as well as multiple sources on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state_and_local_government_response_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic).
